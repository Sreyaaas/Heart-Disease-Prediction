Heart Disease Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting heart disease in patients. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset, which can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Installation
To run this project, you will need to install the following Python packages:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these packages using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
To run the project, simply run the heart_disease_prediction.py script:

Copy code
python heart_disease_prediction.py
This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and train a machine learning model to predict heart disease. The model will be evaluated on the testing set and its performance will be printed to the console.

Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the testing set, indicating that it is effective at predicting heart disease in patients.
